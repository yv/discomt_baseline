Language-model baseline for pronoun prediction
==============================================

This is the language model baseline for pronoun prediction, which we
first used at the DiscoMT 2015 shared task. This is the version for
the WMT 2016 task, which supports multiple languages. Each language
has a configuration file (english.yml, french.yml, german.yml)
which can be selected by adding "--conf thatfile.yml" to the command
line.

For space reason, validation data and language models are not included.
